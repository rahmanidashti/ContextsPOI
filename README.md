# ContextsPOI: Contextual Information on POI Recommendation


![ContextsPOI](https://github.com/rahmanidashti/ContextImpact/blob/master/images/banner.png)

## How to run the framework?

**All of the codes to run the models and processing are located in `codes` folder.**

1. At first step, we need to run the contextual models to get the preference scores of users on POIs based on each contextual influence. To do this, we provide all the contextual models in the `contextsModels` package which are in `lib`. When you run `saveScores.py`, all contextual models which are located in `lib` compute the users' preference score, then they will be saved as `NumPy arrays (.npy)` in `/model_combiner/contexts/dataset` and the dataset can be `Yelp` or `Gowalla`, indicates on which dataset your run the models and get these results. The size of these produces `NumPy arrays` is equal to `user_num * poi_num`.
2. The second step is the embedding of users and POIs that we need them as for the embedding layer of user and POIs in Neural Network based approaches. To embed the user and location into the leaten feature space, you can run the `embedding.py` from the `MFEmbedder` package. the output is two Numpy arrays `U.npy` and `L.npy` which are saved in `/embeddings/dataset/`.

## User and Item Latent Feature Vectors
run `embedding.py` in `MFEmbeder`

## Prerequisites

You will need below libraries to be installed before running the application:

- Python >= 3.4
- NumPy >= 1.19
- SciPy >= 1.6
- PyInquirer >= 1.0.3

For a simple solution, you can simply run the below command in the root directory:

```python
pip install -r prerequisites.txt
```

## TODOs
- [X] The release of base models source codes
- [X] Add context models to save the scores
- [ ] Add command-line run for the context models 
- [ ] final version code release after the acceptance of the paper
- [ ] User behaviour analysis part will be available after the acceptance of the paper.
